Data Science Workflows

The phrase “data science workflow” describes the method or steps by which a data scientist might evaluate data to perform a data analysis from start to finish. In this course we will provide examples of workflows with real data. In general, workflows involve the following steps:

Identifying a question of interest - determining if it is feasible
Identifying data to answer that question
Importing that data into a programming language such as R
Cleaning / wrangling / and tiding the data
Exploratory data analysis to get to know the data
Data analysis to look for associations in the data
Generation of data visualizations to demonstrate findings
Communication of your analysis and findings
We will demonstrate potential ways of organizing a workflow using real data from the https://www.opencasestudies.org/
